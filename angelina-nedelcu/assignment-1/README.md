# Assignment 1

Please submit assignment 1 to this directory.

Remember to create a branch named `angelina-nedelcu-assignment1` instead of submitting to
the `master` branch.

Look at the `assignment-0` directory under the `sample` folder for inspiration
on how to structure your code.

If you have any questions, review the GitHub presentation or reach out to your
group or mentor on Slack.
