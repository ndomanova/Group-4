# Assignment 5

Please submit assignment 5 to this directory.

Remember that this is a group assignment, so there should be a single pull
request at the end of the assignment.

One way to handle this is to create a `group-assignment5` branch and use that
for development.

Different people in the group may:

*   Create their own development branches and send pull request to merge into
    the `group-assignment5` branch.

*   Push commits to the `group-assignment5` branch directly.

*   Create their own development branches and, once the group has agreed to a
    solution, those changes are made again in the `group-assignment5` branch.
    This is the least favorite option because it means doing the same work more
    than once, which is less efficient.

In all cases, it is important to coordinate so that no two people work on the
same exact thing, as, in the end, they would be unable to both merge their
changes.

Look at the `assignment-0` directory under the `sample` folder for inspiration
on how to structure your code.

If you have any questions, review the GitHub presentation or reach out to your
group or mentor on Slack.
